# Customer migration

Move regulated customer records to the new store in a Friday cutover. Product wants no feature
freeze, operations proposes two weeks of dual writes, and compliance requires evidence that every
record remains attributable and deletable. The plan assumes rollback is simply switching reads back
to the old store, but does not define reconciliation for writes accepted after cutover.
