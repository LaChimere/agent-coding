# Branch state: discount-rate-cap

This is the current state of the working branch `fix/discount-rate-cap` in
this repository. The diff in `status/discount-rule.diff` is already committed
and present in the working tree, not a plan for future work.

The change caps the loyalty-tier discount rate at 15%, adds the regression
test that pins the cap, and updates the directly coupled formula doc in
`docs/pricing/discount-formula.md` that documents the cap. All three files
land in the same commit shown in the diff.
